# Overview

This code aims at determining if the dataset needs to be corrected for batch effect bias before applying the clustering algorithm.  
Depending on the results, the following steps are different :    
- if there is no batch effect, we can just merge the data  
- if there is a batch effect, we need to integrate both batches in one object  
As it's better to normalize on individual object before merging or integrating, we work here with the output objects of NormalizeData script.  
We decided here to work with the normalized object without cell cycle regression.

```

We observe on the global UMAP of SCT normalized data that all the conditions overlapped correctly for batch1. For batch2, as expected the conditions are less similar. The global shape of the population are similar between CTRL2 and AOAaK but AOA is very distinct.

The conditions from the same batch overlap less with the log normalization.

Cells from batch1 and batch2 overlap very well except for AOA cells (expected) for the SCT normalization.

The batches overlap less with log normalization. We will preferentially work with SCT normalization for latter analyses.   

# Conclusion 

=> No need for batch effect correction (=integration) if we work with sct normalization after the merge for downstream analysis.

```{r, Rsession}

end_time = Sys.time()

# Clean working space and memory

gc()
